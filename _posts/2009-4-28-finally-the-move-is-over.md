<p>Finally! After a few days my new blog is alive.</p>
<p>I've been using Mephisto for a long time but I felt it was time to change. Mephisto is writen in Ruby On Rails and while I really like Rails I really needed an Blog engine writen in ASP.NET. There were many excelent options like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.subtextproject.com">Subtext</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dasBlog">dasBlog</a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogengine.codeplex.com">BlogEngine.Net</a></p>
<p>All of the above are great blog engines. They are used by most of the community. So which one did I chose? None!</p>
<p>I decided to create my own blog engine. I know, I know...&nbsp; Why?? Am I crazy? Do I want to take over the blog market? Nope!!! All I really wanted was a pet project that I could really use while allowing me to keep trying new stuff. A blog engine is something simple enough that I don't need to worry about the business rules. It's been done over and over and we use it everyday. It is also small enough that if I ever decide to throw all my code in the trash and start over with a different approach I easily could.</p>
<p>For this adventure I created a project at Codeplex: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://speakoutblog.codeplex.com/">SpeakOutBlog</a>.</span> From now on SpeakOut is my sandbox, the place I'm going to try ideas and technologies that interest me. The good thing is that at the same time I'll have do something that works, otherwise my blog will go offline. I don't want to let my fans (my wife, dad and mom) down.</p>
<p>On my next post I'll talk about the difficulties I had with URL Rewriting on my shared hosting. I hope that this project keeps giving me material for the blog.</p>
<p>Oh, before I forget... I really want to thanks the guys that develop Subtext, dasBlog and BlogEngine.Net. Their code is really fun to play with and gave me many ideas to use in SpeakOut. I hope someday someone could look at my code and learn something interesting as I have learned from these guys code.</p>
