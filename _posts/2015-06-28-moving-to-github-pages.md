My blog has been kinda dead for a while for several reasons. One of the reasons for it is I've been busy at work, but who hasn't right? Another reason is that I've always written my own blog engine as a way of testing out ideas on something that is mine and is also in production. That worked ok for several years, I got to test webforms, asp.net mvc, NHibernate, EntityFramework, several IoC containers, Bootstrap and many more. The downside however is I never took the proper time to write an admin area that made it easy to publish my posts. The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot.

Lately I've been meaning to get the blog active again but I so I did some research and using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) seemed like the logical choice. I love Git and GitHub and markdown is a lot better than html to write the posts. It also doesn't hurt that all the cool kids are doing it :-)

So there you have it, this blog has officially been resurrected.
