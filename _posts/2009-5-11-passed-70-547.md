<p>Hey, I'm just writing to let my friend know that I have passed the 70-547 exam and now I'm an MCPD Web Developer.</p>
<p>I have to say that the test was way easier than I thought. I think it was the easiest Microsoft test I have ever taken.</p>
<p>If you are asking why I still took a .NET 2.0 exam the reason is simple. I had already bought all the books last year. I was supposed to take the test last October but I had to help out at work doing some long shifts to deliver a product that was sold before we expected. Go news for them and a lot of work for me :-). Not to worry I really like the guys I work for and the system is kind of a son to me so I also had fun. Now that it's over I'm back to my plans.</p>
<p>Now I'm in the process of getting my MCT (Microsoft Certified Trainer).</p>
<p>I'll keep you guys posted on how it goes.</p>
