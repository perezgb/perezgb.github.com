<p>I just passed the 70-529 exam and now I&rsquo;m a <span class="caps">MCTS</span> Web  and Distributed Applications. For those that are still thinking of taking this  exam here are a few tips.</p>
<p>Usually I use Microsoft preparation books to study for certifications. This  time I started using a book from the same collection:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/MCTS-Self-Paced-Training-70-529-Pro-Certification/dp/0735623325/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219328276&amp;sr=8-2"><span class="caps">MCTS</span> Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-529): Microsoft .NET  Framework 2.0 Distributed Application Development</a></p>
<p>I have to say that I didn&rsquo;t like this book. I didn&rsquo;t think that the content  was well approached and the writing style was also not for me. I still followed  the book to the end but I had to complement it with two other books, one the had  a good web services section and another that had a good remoting section. These  books are:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-ASP-NET-2-0-C-2005/dp/1590594967/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219328619&amp;sr=1-1">Pro  <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET 2.0 in C# 2005</a> (This one complements the web  services part)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-2005-NET-Platform-Third/dp/1590594193/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219328719&amp;sr=1-3">Pro  C# 2005 and the .NET 2.0 Platform</a> (This one complements the remoting  part)</p>
<p>Also a good starting point is the articles on the <a href="http://aspnet.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/100803-1.aspx">4 Guys from  Rolla</a> that will give you a pretty good introduction to web services and it&rsquo;s  best if read before you read any of the books above.</p>
<p>Next week I&rsquo;ll go on vacation and when I come back I&rsquo;ll start my studies  towards the <span class="caps">MCPD</span> Web Developer certification. I should  take the test by the end of November. I&rsquo;ll let you know how this goes.</p>
