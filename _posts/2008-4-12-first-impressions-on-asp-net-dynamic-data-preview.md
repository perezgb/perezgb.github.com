<p>Today I saw a screen cast of <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET Dynamic Data for  the first time. As a Rails enthusiast I must say that I was very excited.</p>
<p>One of the ideas behind this technology is moving application logic into the  models and removing them from the pages. Personally I think that idea is more  than correct since a validation rule on a certain field will be repeated in  every page where the field shows up.</p>
<p>Another great feature is the ability to quickly get something running. That  is one thing that really facilitates talking to clients, after all there is no  better way to talk a client than showing something running and from there you  can define further requirements and move on with the development process.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very excited to see the direction in which Microsoft is going with new  ideas like the Dynamic Data Preview and the <span class="caps">MVC</span>  framework. It shows that they a really connected to what is going on in the  development world and keep taking the new ideas from other technologies and  improving the .Net framework. So far the future of 3.5 looks bright.</p>
<p>To get to know the <span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET Dynamic Data Preview  better look at the following screencast by David Ebbo: <a href="http://sessions.visitmix.com/?selectedSearch=T24"><span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET Dynamic Data Preview</a></p>
