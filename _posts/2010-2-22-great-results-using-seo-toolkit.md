<p>When I decided to test the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.iis.net/expand/SEOToolkit">Search Engine Optimization &nbsp;Toolkit</a>&nbsp;to check my blog health. I wanted to see if I had many broken links, pages missing titles and things like that. For this purpose the tool was really useful because I found a bug in the way I was generating the tags for the posts. I fixed this issue and many other minor ones like post titles being to long.</p>
<p>What really amazed me about the SEO Toolkit was only clear about one month later, after the search engines had the chance to crawl my site a few times. Google Analytics is showing an amazing increase in traffic: 89%! This is a lot. I really didn't expect that much improvement. Congrats to Microsoft once more on the job well done.</p>
<p>Here is a weekly view of the number of visits. I optimized my blog with the IIS Toolkit on the end of the year. Can you notice the improvement?</p>

<p>I wanted to show the comparison report generated for my site before and after I made the fixes but I formatted my notebook last week and lost all the reports. Shame on me!</p>
