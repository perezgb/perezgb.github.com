<p>Today I made it to the Top 10 Answerers of the <a href="http://forum.asp.net/">asp.net forums</a> for the first time and I&rsquo;m really  happy with it.</p>
<p>I just hope it&rsquo;s not too geeky of me to be celebrating this&hellip; My wife seems to  think so!</p>
<p>I like the forums because they always give me new challenges to help me learn  more. I get problems from people all over the world and it makes me learn a lot  of things that I wouldn&rsquo;t on my day to day job. If that makes me a geek so be  it.</p>
