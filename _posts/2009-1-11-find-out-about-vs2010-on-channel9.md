<p>If you want to find out what&rsquo;s coming up in Visual Studio 2010 you have to  check out the new podcast on <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/">Channel9</a>  called <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/">10-4</a>. The first  podcast of the series shows you how to download and install <span class="caps">VS2010</span>. The cool thing is that installation is already  available as a virtual machine so you don&rsquo;t need to worry about messing up you  development machine.</p>
<p>The second episode shows a feature that is really simple but I always wanted.  It let&rsquo;s you manage you list of recent projects so that you can pin or remove  projects. I know, I know&hellip; this is not going to change my life and there are a  whole lot of more meaningful features but I just thought it was pretty cool  since I&rsquo;ve always wanted this.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/10-4/">10-4</a> podcast  site and draw your own conclusions on <span class="caps">VS2010</span> new  features.</p>
