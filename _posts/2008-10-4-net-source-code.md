<p>Have you ever wondered what&rsquo;s behind all the classes you use in the .Net  framework? Now that Microsoft opened the code you can have a pick at it.</p>
<p>I think that the looking at this code is a great way to learn and also be a  better programmer since you will understand what happens behind the scenes. If  you have a doubt if some <span class="caps">API</span> or control is the source of  a performance problem you can take a look for yourself.</p>
<p>VisualStudio let&rsquo;s you download the code as needed during debug but there&rsquo;s a  great tool called <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/NetMassDownloader">NetMassDownloader</a> that will  allow you to download all the code at once. The total size of the source code is  about 170 MB.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a good post on the CodeProject site that will show how to set it  up with VisualStudio: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/netmassdownloader.aspx">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/netmassdownloader.aspx</a>.</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
