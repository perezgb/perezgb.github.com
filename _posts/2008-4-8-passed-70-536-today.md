<p>Today I passed the 70-536 exam (Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 &ndash; Application  Development Foundation). Some parts of the exam are really interesting because  you get to use them every day, like regular expressions, IO, threads, reflection  etc. Others are a little more boring to study like Application Domains. Overall  the contents of the exam are very helpful for developers who write more serious  coding.</p>
<p>For those who are thinking about taking the exam, here is the recipe  I used:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Studied about 2 hours a day for 2 months</li>
    <li>Used the <span class="caps">MCTS</span> Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-536):  Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation, which is quite  good</li>
    <li>Worked with .Net for about 2 years</li>
    <li>It is very important to write code. Don&rsquo;t think you can just read a book and  go take the exam. Explore different scenarios, try new ideas. Only then you&rsquo;ll  be ready for the exam.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now my next goal is to pass 70-528 and get the <span class="caps">MCTS</span>  certification. This one should be easier to pass since I work with web apps  every day. In about two months I hope I will have nailed it.</p>
