<p>Well, today I got one more certification out of the way. I have just arrived  from the Prometric test center where I passed the 70-528 (aka Microsoft .NET  Framework 2.0 &ndash; Web-Based Client Development). Now I&rsquo;m a Microsoft Certified  Technology Specialist (MCTS): .NET Framework 2.0 Web Applications.</p>
<p>Overall I considered the test to be easy compared to the 70-536. If you use  the Microsoft certification books and you already have hands on experience you  shouldn&rsquo;t have any trouble passing this exam.</p>
<p>Now I will concentrate in the 70-529 (aka Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 &ndash;  Distributed Application Development) exam and I think this will keep me busy for  another 2 months or so. My goal is to get as many certifications as I can until  next year when I planning to move to Canada. Since I don&rsquo;t know any one there I  figure that the certifications are the most universal way of proving my  knowledge.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone that helped me!</p>
